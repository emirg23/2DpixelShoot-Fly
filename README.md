made in unity within 3 weeks, except audio everything was made by me.
I'm 2nd year student and don't have much experience so while I got time, I don't want to jump straight in any field, so not planning on making games for a while. I will focus on swift.

CONTROLS


esc / pause button = pause / resume



"w" / up arrow = fly up


"a" / left arrow = fly left


"s" / down arrow = fly down


"d" / right arrow = fly right




"e" / space = shoot


"f" = enable/disable auto-shoot mode
