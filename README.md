made in unity within 3 weeks, except audio everything was made by me.
I'm 2nd year student and don't have much experience so while I got time, I don't want to jump straight in any field, so not planning on making games for a while. I will focus on swift.

CONTROLS
esc / pause button = pause

"w" / up arrow = fly up
"a" / left arrow = fly left
"s" / down arrow = fly down
"d" / right arrow = fly right

"e" / space = shoot
"f" = toggle auto-shoot mode
